## Why Siege?

### The Pain Points of Using Claude Code / Codex Directly

If you've been using Claude Code or Codex CLI for real-world projects, you've probably run into these frustrations:

| Pain Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **No project continuity** | Every conversation starts from scratch. You lose context between sessions — no memory of what was planned, what was built, what was reviewed. |
| **No structured workflow** | You go from "idea" to "write code" with nothing in between. No technical design, no task breakdown, no review process. Just raw prompting. |
| **Invisible progress** | There's no dashboard, no timeline, no way to see what's done vs. what's pending. You're managing everything in your head. |
| **No code review** | AI writes code, you merge it. There's no diff viewer, no inline findings, no structured quality gate before code hits your repo. |
| **One-shot execution** | Large tasks fail or produce incomplete results because there's no way to break them into smaller, sequential steps with context passing. |
| **No test generation** | After implementation, testing is manual. There's no AI-driven test case generation tied to what was actually built. |
| **Terminal-only UX** | Everything happens in a terminal. No visual schedule, no Gantt chart, no clickable UI to manage the development lifecycle. |

### How Siege Solves This

Siege wraps Claude Code / Codex into a **full development lifecycle manager** with a visual UI:

```
 Plan  →  Scheme  →  Schedule  →  Execute  →  Review  →  Test
  │         │          │            │           │          │
Describe   AI Gen    Gantt       Claude      Diff View   AI Gen
+ Tags    + Edit    Timeline   Code/Codex   + Findings  + Run
```

- **Persistent context** — Projects, plans, schemes, and execution logs are all stored in SQLite. Pick up where you left off.
- **Structured design** — AI generates technical schemes before writing any code. Review and refine via chat before committing to implementation.
- **Visual task scheduling** — AI breaks work into ordered tasks displayed on a Gantt chart. Each task executes with context from previous tasks.
- **GitHub PR-style code review** — See actual `git diff` with syntax highlighting, file tree navigation, inline AI findings, and one-click AI fix.
- **AI-powered testing** — Auto-generate and run test cases based on what was implemented.
- **Multi-provider AI** — Use Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), or GLM (ZhiPu). Works with API keys, proxy relays, or Claude subscription login.

## Core Workflow

**1. Create Project** — Select a local repo or clone from GitHub. AI auto-detects `CLAUDE.md` for project context.

**2. Create Plan** — Describe what you want to build. AI generates a title. Organize in folders, tag as feature/bug/refactor.

**3. Generate Scheme** — AI searches the web and analyzes local code to produce technical proposals. Edit, review, or modify via chat.

**4. Generate Schedule** — AI breaks confirmed schemes into executable tasks with a Gantt chart timeline.

**5. Execute** — Run tasks via Claude Code or Codex CLI with real-time SSE progress streaming. Each task inherits context from previously completed tasks.

**6. Code Review** — View `git diff` with syntax highlighting and file tree navigation. AI reviews for quality, security, and correctness. Findings are pinned to specific lines. Click "AI Fix" for one-click remediation.

**7. Test** — AI generates and runs test cases to verify the implementation.

## Features

### AI Integration
- **Multi-provider**: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), GLM (ZhiPu)
- **Proxy support**: Custom base URL for API relays
- **Claude Code login**: Works with your subscription, no API key needed
- **Session reuse**: Subsequent AI calls in the same plan resume the session (~10x faster)
- **Serial queue**: One AI task at a time, no process pile-up

### Code Review
- **Git diff viewer** with syntax highlighting (highlight.js)
- **File tree sidebar** with collapsible directories, +/- stats, and finding count badges
- **Inline findings** pinned to specific lines with severity badges
- **Inline comments** with AI-generated fix suggestions
- **One-click "AI Fix"** — apply AI suggestions directly to files
- **View mode toggle** — switch between diff view and findings list

### Project Management
- **Folder hierarchy** for organizing plans
- **Tags**: feature, bug, enhancement, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf
- **Recently opened** projects on homepage
- **Custom icons** per project

### Scheme Management
- **AI generation** with provider and skill selection
- **Conversational modification** — chat to refine schemes
- **Version history** with line-by-line diff
- **Scheme review** with severity-tagged findings

### Execution
- **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI** as execution engines
- **Skills integration** from `~/.claude/skills/`
- **SSE real-time progress** streaming
- **Gantt chart** schedule visualization

### Data Management
- **Auto-archive** completed plans after configurable days
- **Backup** to Local filesystem, Obsidian vault, or Notion
- **Import** plans from Markdown files
- **SQLite** — zero-ops, single file database

### i18n
- Full Chinese and English support
- All UI labels, status badges, and messages translated

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Kotodian/siege.git
cd siege

# Install
npm install

# Start
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — the onboarding guide will walk you through GitHub connection, AI configuration, and creating your first project.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **Claude Code** (`claude` CLI) — for AI features without API key
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) — optional, for GitHub repo integration

### AI Configuration

Siege supports three modes for AI access:

| Mode | Speed | Setup |
|------|-------|-------|
| **API Key** | Fast (streaming) | Get key from provider console |
| **Proxy/Relay** | Fast | Custom base URL + key |
| **Claude Login** | ~1-2 min/call | Just `claude login`, no key needed |

Configure in **Settings** or during onboarding.
